    <h2>Health Benifits.</h2>
    <p>Onion pakoda, a popular Indian snack made from onions and gram flour (besan), has several health benefits when consumed in moderation and prepared with healthier methods like air frying. Onions are rich in antioxidants, particularly quercetin, which helps reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. They support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and preventing blood clots and plaque buildup. The high fiber content in onions aids digestion, promotes gut health, and helps regulate blood sugar levels.</p>
    <p>Gram flour used in onion pakoda is gluten-free, rich in plant-based protein, magnesium, iron, and fiber, supporting muscle health, digestion, and bone strength. Spices like turmeric and cumin provide antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects, boosting immunity. Onion pakoda offers a quick energy source due to its carbohydrate content and can help enhance mood through the release of endorphins stimulated by spices. However, because it is typically deep-fried, it can be calorie-dense, so eating it occasionally or opting for air-fried versions improves its health profile. Overall, onion pakoda is a flavorful snack that combines nutritional benefits from its core ingredients with satisfying taste.​​</p>
