        <h1>Nutritional Benifits</h1>
        <h3>Nutritional Profile of Biscuit-Type Recipes</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A typical serving (30g or two biscuits) contains approximately 150 kcal, with 20g carbohydrates, 6g fat, 2g dietary fiber, 6g sugar, and 150mg sodium</li>
            <li>Whole wheat flour contributes fiber, supporting digestion and gut health, while also providing B vitamins like thiamine and niacin essential for energy metabolism.</li>
            <li>Eggs add high-quality protein (about 6g per egg), vitamin B12, choline, and selenium, which support brain and metabolic functions.</li>
        </ol>
        

        <h3>Vitamins and Minerals</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Recipes using whole wheat flour are sources of magnesium (6.46–25.68 mg/100g), phosphorus (28.39–64.33 mg/100g), potassium (10.95–59.57 mg/100g), and iron (1.66–8.47 mg/100g), which are vital for nerve function, bone health, and oxygen transport.</li>
            <li>Enriched formulations may contain vitamin E (4.07–8.78 mg/100g) and vitamin C (2.36–13.15 mg/100g) when fruit pulps or sprouted grains are added, though basic recipes with only flour, sugar, egg, and salt have minimal amounts.</li>
            <li>Calcium levels can reach up to 18.13 mg/100g, supporting bone strength, especially when fortified or made with nutrient-dense ingredients.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Health Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The fiber from whole wheat flour helps regulate blood sugar and supports bowel regularity, making such recipes beneficial when consumed in moderation.</li>
            <li>Substituting refined flour with sprouted grains increases antioxidant activity, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and total soluble phenolic compounds, which may reduce inflammation and improve metabolic health.

</li>
            <li>Lower glycemic index values are observed in whole wheat or sprouted grain-based biscuits, making them suitable for sustained energy release</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>NOTE:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>High sugar and sodium content in sweet or salted biscuits should be monitored, especially for individuals with hypertension or diabetes.</li>
            <li>While basic recipes provide energy and some micronutrients, their nutritional value can be enhanced by adding seeds, oats, or fruit-based ingredients.</li>
            <li>In summary, recipes using wheat flour, sugar, egg, and salt offer moderate calories and essential nutrients like B vitamins, fiber, and minerals, but their health benefits increase significantly when made with whole grains or enriched ingredients</li>
        </ol>
