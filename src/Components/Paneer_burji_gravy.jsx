    <h2>Health Benifits.</h2>
  <h3>Muscle Growth and Repair</h3>
  <p>Paneer (cottage cheese) is an excellent source of casein protein, which supports muscle growth and repair, making Paneer Bhurji a gym-friendly, high-protein meal for vegetarians and fitness enthusiasts.</p>
  <p>Protein also supports faster recovery post-exercise and helps maintain lean body mass.</p>
  <br />

  <h3>Bone and Teeth Health</h3>
  <p>Paneer is rich in calcium and phosphorus, which are important for strong bones and teeth.</p>
  <p>One serving contains about 36–38% of daily calcium needs, aiding in bone strength for all age groups.</p>
   <br />

  <h3>Weight Management and Satiety</h3>
  <p>The combination of high protein and low carbohydrates helps improve satiety, supports weight loss goals, and keeps you feeling fuller for longer.</p>
  <p>Paneer digests slowly, making it beneficial for diabetics and those looking to manage blood sugar.</p>
   <br />

  <h3>Heart Health</h3>
  <p>Potassium in paneer helps reduce the impact of excess sodium, lowers blood pressure, and supports heart health.</p>
  <p>Healthy fats in paneer and olive oil support hormone production and overall cellular function.</p>
   <br />

  <h3>Improved Digestion and Immunity</h3>
  <p>Addition of vegetables boosts fiber content, aiding digestion and supporting healthy bowel movements.​</p>
  <p>Vitamins like vitamin C from tomatoes and capsicum enhance immunity and help defend against common illnesses.</p>
   <br />

  <h3>Other Nutritional Benefits</h3>
  <p>Paneer Bhurji provides vitamins (A, B1, B2, B3, C, E, folic acid), minerals (magnesium, zinc, iron, potassium), and antioxidants for general wellbeing.</p>
  <p>Using low-fat paneer and minimal oil can further increase the nutritional profile and make it suitable for weight management, diabetics, and heart patients.</p>
